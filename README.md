Tank Battle Game
This project involves building an interactive tank battle game, incorporating various gaming elements such as movement, AI, collision detection, game states, and a level system.

Features
Game Window: The game initiates with an interactive window set with a specific title, size, and coordinates. Window event listeners are incorporated to manage user inputs.

Game States: The game incorporates different states like the main menu, help, about, in-game, and game-over, which guide the user interactions.

Rendering: The game utilizes an FPS-based rendering mechanism, ensuring smooth transitions and animations.

Tank Objects: Tanks are the primary entities with defined movements, boundary controls, and the ability to shoot bullets.

Graphics: Tank entities are visually represented through images. Screen flickering problems are solved with double buffering.

Efficiency: An object pool is used for managing bullet objects, ensuring high game efficiency.

Enemy AI: Enemy tanks are computer-controlled, generating at random locations and exhibiting dynamic behaviors.

Explosion Effects: Explosion objects, managed via object pools, are used to create visually appealing effects upon collision.
